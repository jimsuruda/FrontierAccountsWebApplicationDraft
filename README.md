# FrontierAccounts



I used .NET Core to throw the data up on the page formatted as per the user story.

Accounts appear in the correct column, all 7 accounts are displayed with formatting, and empty dates are hidden

I went over the allowed time so left my development UI as is, given another hour I would throw the data into the provided list templates instead of  tables.
